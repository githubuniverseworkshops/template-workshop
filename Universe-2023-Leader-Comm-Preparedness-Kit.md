# [Universe 2023 | Leader Communications Preparedness Kit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12xv6DH5TM5k4y8lDnyEjiYiuzSyXicGtY100haY98-w/edit)
The GitHub Communications team has built a guide for messaging, comms, and speaker readiness for all Universe programs. In this kit you will find among many other things:
- High Level Company & Product Messaging
- GitHub Community and Customer Numbers that can be shared publicly
- Presentation Templates for any slides you build

**Please Note:** You will find information and reference for speakers that have access to the Universe Speaker Portal. Unless you are speaking on stage at The YBCA for Universe you will not have access to this speaker portal and you can disregard any information that references the portal.
